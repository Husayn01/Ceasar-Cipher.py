# Ceasar-Cipher
#### An implementation of the Ceasar cipher algorithm in python





This repository contains a simple implementation of the Caesar cipher algorithm in Python. The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known encryption techniques, used by Julius Caesar himself to secure his military communications. 

It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Key features of this Caesar cipher implementation include:

- Encryption and decryption: The program provides functions to both encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher.
- Customizable shift: You can specify the number of positions to shift the letters in the alphabet, allowing for different encryption keys.
- Support for uppercase and lowercase letters: The cipher can handle both uppercase and lowercase letters while preserving their case.
- Handling of non-alphabetic characters: Non-alphabetic characters in the input message are preserved and remain unchanged in the output.

Whether you're interested in learning about cryptography or simply want to explore the workings of the famous Caesar cipher, this Python implementation serves as an educational and practical resource. 

Feel free to fork, contribute, or use it as a basis for your own projects involving encryption and decryption.
